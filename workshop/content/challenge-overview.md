Thank you for taking the time to participate in this `customer empathy challenge`. Your willingness to try out the customer journey with our Tanzu portfolio of products and projects will help to deliver a better experience for our customers.

The goal of this exercise is to have you go through a real world scenario of a customer that has recently purchased our products. In order to maximize the value of this exercise, we would like to gauge your feedback at three different points:

* Before you begin
* Half way through
* At the end of the exercise. 

You will find the survey in a tab at the right of this documentation.

```dashboard:open-dashboard
name: Survey
```

This challenge will offer three personas that you can choose from based upon your knowledge and experience. You should have chosen the one that you are most confident that you will be able to complete. 

The personas are:
* Application Developer
* Application DevOps 
* Platform Operations

We will provide you in this environment with all the required instructions and helper tools you will need to get started with the challenge.

Please read through the instructions carefully before beginning.
