This challenge walks you through the workflow of an enterprise developer that needs to deploy his or her first application to Kubernetes. It’s a simple service that uses a database to store information. As part of this challenge, you will experience the inner loop workflow that is starting from development on your local laptop all the way to having a running application on a remote Kubernetes cluster. The inner loop refers to the quick, iterative development that happens before you push your code to a git repository. The objective of the challenge is a working application that you have developed and tested on a Kubernetes cluster and that can be shared via a URL.

As the challenge is not meant to test your coding skills, the source code will be provided for you. Your goal is to deploy the application to Kubernetes and make a change to the code base in order to see how that change is applied to your running application. This is the first step most developers would go through when targeting Kubernetes as their deployment platform. It’s what can be defined as the `developer day-1 workflow`.
