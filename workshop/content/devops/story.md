This challenge walks you through the workflow of an enterprise DevOps engineer that wants to build, test, and deploy an application by creating a software delivery pipeline using Tekton. The application is a simple service that connects to a database to store its stateful information. 

As the task is not meant to test your coding or operations skills, weâ€™re going to provide you with the source code to use in a Git repository and the image to use for the database along with the deployment descriptors. This will provide all of the necessary components required to have a fully running application on a Kubernetes cluster. We will also provide you with an installer script that will install all the required capabilities on the cluster for you to use.

Your goal is to create a pipeline that will fetch the source code, build a container image, push the image into a container registry, create a kubernetes namespace on the cluster and finally to deploy the application in that namespace. You should get a URL to verify that your application is live after the deployment is completed. You will then make a change in the application source code and trigger the execution of the pipeline (manually or automatically). You should be able to see the change in the URL you had before.

Every application needs a minimum a pipeline like this, and your goal today will be to create this experience to enhance developer workflows when using Kubernetes.
